## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to build models to predict the number of
social media shares that an online news article will receive.
Specifically, I will train several logistic regression models and random
forest models, use repeated 10-fold cross-validation to select a single
candidate model for each type of algorithm, then compare those candidate
models on the holdout test data set. This process will be repeated for
every day of the week on which an article can be published (i.e.,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).

The data used in this project is the [Online News
Popularity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity)
data set available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. All of the
news articles in referenced in this data set were published by
[Mashable](https://www.mashable.com), and can be referenced using the
`url` variable. The data dictionary is available on the UCI website for
the data set linked above.

## Data

The data set contains 58 predictor variables and one target variable
(`shares`). The predictor variables are either numeric or binary and
represent various statistics associated with the news articles.

As mentioned before, I will be creating a different model for each day
of the week, as denoted by the `weekday_is_*` indicator variables.
Therefore, these variables (along with `is_weekend`) will not be
included in my model-building process.

The other predictor variables attempt to measure a number of things.
Some metadata about the article is available, such as number of links,
images, and videos. Additionally, the channel (or segment) that the
article falls under is also available as a set of indicator variables.
These include channels such as lifestyle, entertainment, and technology.

Most of the remaining predictor variables are derived using natural
language processing techniques. These include variables that tokenize
the text and provide counts, such as number of tokens in the title,
article content, stop words, and unique tokens. There is another set of
indicator variables that is created from a form of unsupervised
clustering in natural language processing, called Latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA). There are also variables related to article sentiment
and polarity. These variables describe the overall feeling that an
articleâ€™s text provides, as well as describing how polarizing the
language in the title is.

## Reports

As previously mentioned, I created reports for every weekday. Each
report contains the above Intro and Data sections, along with
summarizations and models specific to the analyzed day. You can
view them by using the following links for the respective weekday:

* [Monday](weekday_is_monday.md)
* [Tuesday](weekday_is_tuesday.md)
* [Wednesday](weekday_is_wednesday.md)
* [Thursday](weekday_is_thursday.md)
* [Friday](weekday_is_friday.md)
* [Saturday](weekday_is_saturday.md)
* [Sunday](weekday_is_sunday.md)

## Automation

This code was used to create reports for all of the `weekday_is_*`
variables. It can be executed in R to recreate the reports.

``` r
# Code referenced from class notes
weekday_vars = list("weekday_is_monday", "weekday_is_tuesday", "weekday_is_wednesday",
                  "weekday_is_thursday", "weekday_is_friday", "weekday_is_saturday",
                  "weekday_is_sunday")

# Create output file names and parameter lists
output_file <- paste0(weekday_vars, ".md")
params = lapply(weekday_vars, FUN = function(x){list(day = x)})

# Create tibble of reports to create
reports <- tibble(output_file, params)

# Create reports
pwalk(reports, rmarkdown::render,
      input = "arharvey_project2.Rmd",
      output_format = rmarkdown::github_document(toc = TRUE, pandoc_args = "--webtex"))
```
